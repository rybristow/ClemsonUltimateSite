<font face="Arial Bold" size=16 color="White"> Ross "I'm having a great time" Hanson </font> <br>
<font face="Browallia New" size="4" color="white" > The First Thing you need to know about Ross, is that he is a king. One of three
kings in fact. One of three wise kings, who are men, and could be labeled as old. Ross, Shoue, and AJ form a trynamic trio, and they are 
literally unstoppable. They are so good, in fact, that they actually plan on moving to Bratislava and joining the Slovakian national
frisbee team. Team USA, watch out. In a similar fashion to Shoue, Ross' favorite throw is also a fake, but to compliment Shoue, Ross' favorite
throw is his "Turn yo head around and see, 'Boy the back of yo head is ridiculous'" fake high release flick. Ross' sports background
includes swimming really fast....in a speedo...  ... Anywho, Ross has been playing frisbee since he was a junior in high school.
Ross would like to make it publicly known that he is in no way related to the 90's boy band that shares his last name.
Ross would also like his fans to know that he takes a deep, but secret pleasure in dominating in alternative sports. He is a frequent
subscriber to ESPN 8, the ocho. Ross' favorite memory, ironically, is the tournament that shall not be named, but begins with
term, and ends in inus. On a more personal note from Ross himself "Viper yells a lot...specifically at me."

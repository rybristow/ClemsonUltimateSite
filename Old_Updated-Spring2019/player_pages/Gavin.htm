<p >
<font face="Arial Bold" size=16 color="White"> Gavin Ervin </font> <br>
<font face="Browallia New" size="4" color="white" > Gavin was also a rookie last year and made his presence known as he liked to party.  From Florence, SC he
is getting a degree in Civil Engineering.  When asked about his favorite throw he responded with "HAMMER OR DIE!!!!" a little agrressive but thats Gavin for you,
when asked for a quote he stated "I got nothing, I like women" well stated.  His favorite nickname is "faun" although I've heard a total of no one ever call him that.
The best thing about Gavin is that he can really pump up the team with his pep talks that are peppered with mass amounts of hate for the other team.  There is nothing more
entertaining or offensive than Gavin when he is winning something handily.

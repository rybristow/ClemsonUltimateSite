<p >
<font face="Arial Bold" size=16 color=White> Kyle "Blueberry" "Spoon" Corley </font> <br>
<font face="'Browallia New'" size="4" color="white" > Kyle Corley has been roaming the streets of Columbia since the ripe age of 9. He is
originally from Irmo, SC and likes to eat bagels and drink gatorade. In Those are two of his hobbies. When he is not participating 
in such shenanigans, Kyle likes to be in the great outdoors. Kyle played baseball and hockey as a youngster. After getting bigger, he
ran for his high school's cross country and track teams. In high school, Kyle also became a big disc golfer, 
in participation, not size. After doing those two activities,running and disc golf for a while, Kyle thought "How can I combine throwing discs
and my odd love for running into one sport?" And that is the day that Kyle began playing ultimate. Since then a few years have 
gone by. In high school, however, Kyle formed Dutch Fork's first ultimate frisbee team alongside fellow Clemsonian ultimate club players Greg Leaphart and Graham Temples. Kyle also spent one summer playing in the Columbia
Ultimate Disc Association's summer league before coming to Clemson. An important thing to know about Kyle is that he tends to forget maps 
on backpacking trips. Even though Kyle may not be one known for the occasional sky, he's definitely getting there. On a final note, Kyle is
simply a fan of good music, the outdoors, and bagels.</font></p>

<p >
<font face="Arial Bold" size=16 color="White"> Erik "Shaft" Messina </font> <br>
<font face="Browallia New" size="4" color="white" > Let's begin by saying that Erik, is a pretty cool guy. He began running track and cross coutnry in the 6th. Since that time, 
he has accumulated 40 track meet metals (and not the chocolate filled kind). He ran cross country, winter track and spring track in high school. He has also been 
playing basketball since he was in the 7th grade and now plays intramurals. He started plyaing some pickup ultimate in high school but nothing real serious until
college. Something good to know about Erik before you comment on his outfit is "The clothes in my closet cost more than some people's car." Take that Mustang. 
Erik plays frisbee because he is pretty good, and he is, and he likes to win, which we hope to do. Shaft's favorite memory from frisbee is his foot block in fall league
that turned around into a layout for a score during fall league. His favorite throw is gunslinger, which I am hoping will become our team throw. Something important
to know about Shaft is that he is also our new team #21, which he shares with Roberto Clemente, Warren Spahn, Tim Duncan, Peter Forsberg, and former Cemson player
John Breen.

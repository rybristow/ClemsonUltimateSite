<font face="Arial Bold" size=16 color="White"> Nick "Fievul" Jewell </font> <br>
<font face="Browallia New" size="4" color="white" > Nick "Fievul" Jewell has a past steeped in Ultimate, from his Easley highschool days where he would play
small colleges around the area, to College of Charleston where he played for the Bums and honed in his airbounce skills, and finally to Clemson where he 
has become a most unorthidox player.  When asked about his favorite throw Nick said " The round yo head, slap yo mamma in the face bid huck for the win"
one can only imagine the complexity of that throw.  Nicks favorite passtime is to host his morning show with Will Gordon "NICK AND WILL IN THE MORNING!"
I have literally no idea what that means.  Know this, if you take Nick to a party keep an eye on him and you just might see a glimpse of the infamous 
"Fievul" shine through and then . . . . take cover, Fievul is one belligerent bull in a china shop.  When asked for a quote Nick put simply  
. . . . "I like to Party"

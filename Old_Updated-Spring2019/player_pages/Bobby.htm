<font face="Arial Bold" size=16 color="White"> Bobby O'Brien </font> <br>
<font face="Browallia New" size="4" color="white" > Bobby is fast and when I say fast I don't mean oh he can beat you to the disc, I mean he
could outrun the disc and still have time to take your sister to dinner before coming back to beat you to the disc.  Can you beat him in the air, probably 
but luckily for him he never has to worry about that since we only throw him laserbeams to the endzone. From Charleston SC Bobby played pick-up ultimate
in high school but didn't appreciate it fully until he joined up with Clemson Joint Chiefs.  As you can see in the photo Bobby isn't afraid to ride dirty 
and then outrun a cop car.  When asked for a quote Bobby stated " You know how the Coyote was always chasing the Roadrunner in Looney Toons, well the Roadrunner was always 
chasing me I was just too fast for the camera to catch."  Ladies and Gents Bobby O'Brien

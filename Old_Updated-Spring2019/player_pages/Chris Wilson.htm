<font face="Arial Bold" size=16 color="White"> Chris Wilson </font> <br>
<font face="Browallia New" size="4" color="white" > Nick Jewell, a.k.a. 5ewell, is originally from Easley, South Carolina.
He began playing frisbee when he was in high school at a pick-up level. Nick's sports background is he ran cross country from
7th to twelth grade, ran track in 11th, and played soccer in 10th. Nick's favorite throw is the layout greatest. Last year, he played
collegiately for the College of Charleston Bums. This year, he is no longer a bum, but a chief. Nick likes to travel. Especially during 
Christmas break when Nick goes skiing on Mount Everest does his travel interests become apparent. Nick's favorite frisbee memory
is his first point on the field for the CoC Bums, when he went deep and skyed his defender and scored. So Legit. Nick plays frisbee
because he both likes to win and likes to run. When you run down to guard Nick on a point, know he said this "I like to party."

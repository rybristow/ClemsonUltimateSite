<font face="Arial Bold" size=16 color="White"> Jesse "Miller Light" Gysin </font> <br>
<font face="Browallia New" size="4" color="white" > Jesse is your classic all American kid.  Loves the outdoors, loves ultimate, goes to church, good kind heart, but lacks a soul due to the
gingerness of his hair no matter how increadible his neard (neck beard) may look.  But luckily for him he is not the only one on our team he and nolan bond a lot over what it truly
means to be soulless.  Jesse recieved his nickname "Miller Light" because he played like an aggressive old man we once knew (Miller Yoho) except he was half Millers size, thus making him much
lighter.  Jesse although kind off the field has a nickname for a reason, this kid allows you to think he is going to get pushed over and then comes back with a vengence.  Before you know
it Miller Light has made a fire cut (actual cut no pun on his gingerness) and burned you up the line for a score.  Don't make this kid angry you will regret it.  Ladies and Gents the
one and only Jesse "Miller Light" Gysin.

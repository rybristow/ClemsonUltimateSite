<font face="Arial Bold" size=16 color="White"> Mark Connoly </font> <br>
<font face="Browallia New" size="4" color="white" > Mark Connoly is frisbee. Is there really anything else to say? maybe. Mark grew up in Abidjan, Ivory Coast. If you type
into google and search odd places to live, you can actually see Mark's house. He grew up in a crocodile shaped house bulit by the infamous Moussa Kalo. Why is Moussa famous?
That's a story for another player bio. Anywho, Mark knew while he was prowling those wily halls that one day he would catch something similar to this
<a href="http://www.beachultimate.org/blog/croc.jpg">crocodile</a>. In more recent history, Mark ran cross country and track. His favorite event in track was the 
800 meter challenge in which his P.R. was a blazing 13. That's right, a 13. Mark has been playing frisbee for about that long and claims that Ben Slade,the myth, the man, the legend,
taught him everything he knows. Mark likes to drive a ballin moped on his off days,.... and his on days. Mark wants all of his fans to know that he plays ultimate 
because he loves running and competitive sports, it tastes great, and its good for you. His favorite frisbee memory is the 2008 Elon try-out tournament, but very soon, it 
will actually be the 2010 ACC tournament. Mark would like all of his competitors to know, he's actually from Conneticut, or so he says.....

<font face="Arial Bold" size=16 color="White"> Drew Throckmorton </font> <br>
<font face="Browallia New" size="4" color="white" > Drew Throckmorton was destined to be a great soccer player from birth.
Wait, isn't this a frisbee bio, oh that's right. Sorry... Drew Throckmorton is basically the illegitimate child of Landon Donovon, a pretty
good soccer player, and Mia Hamm, so he is very athletic. Now, obviously he is in no way related to either one of these people, but his father was
one of the best prep high school soccer players of his time, and his mother was the same, but in the woman's division. Throck's brother is 
currently a junior in high school and he is also one of the top players in the state. As for Throck, he played football in high school
and dabbled in soccer(tried out for team USA, got accepted, then declined) until he was in high school. Throck first began playing frisbee
when he was 15 and in high school but was not shown the true path until Ben Slade, the myth, the man, the legend, showed him the true
path. Throck's favorite throw is raise the roof, formerly known as elevator pass. Throck plays ultimate to win, and for him, 
"there's one rule in the house ....don't touch my drumset......DONT TOUCH IT!!!!!! That was about a six you don't wanna hear a ten."
In Throck's own words "#10 is reserved for greatness, I've got number 10, now if I could only be great...."

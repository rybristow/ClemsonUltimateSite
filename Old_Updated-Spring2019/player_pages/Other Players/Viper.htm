<p >
<font face="Arial Bold" size=16 color=White> Michael Parks </font> <br>
<font face="'Browallia New'" size="4" color="white" a> Viper enjoys playing frisbee. He has been playing frisbee for almost ten years ever since he was a student
at Charlotte Latin Middle School. Viper has come a long way and a foot or so vertically since he began playing. Viper's sports background
includes soccer, basketball, and a lot of ultimate. Viper's favorite throw is a backhand "around yo face." Viper was a new year's present for his
parents a little more than 21 years ago. Two things that Viper wants his fans to know are: 1. He does have a life, and 2.facetiously has all the
vowels of the alphabet in order.  Even though I need to ask, who knew, before looking at his profile page, his real name was Michael Parks, Viper/Michael is our 
other, d-line (which rocks), fearless leader.

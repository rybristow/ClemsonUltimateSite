<font face="Arial Bold" size=16 color=White> Jonathan Plyler </font> <br>
<font face="'Browallia New'" size="4" color="white" a> J.P. is big. After 
sitting out of the college scene for a couple of years, he has come back to play 
for Clemson for his senior season. J.P. played ultimate in 2005-2007 for 
Winthrop University. After his sophomore year, he transferred to Clemson. Due to 
time constraints and injuries he was not able to play last year for the joint 
chiefs. We are excited to have J.P. back and have the average height of our team 
raised a couple inches. J.P.'s sports background is interesting as he was a 
curler in his younger years. His favorite throw is either the IO long bomb 
flick, or the mythical helicopter throw. Thought to be found only in fairy tales 
and ancient greece, J.P. brings the helicopter to life, and it is both 
devastatingly and deliciously good. An interesting life experience J.P. had was 
when he was in the ninth grade he attended a Britney Spears concert on April 
6th, 2000. But this was to be a Britney Spears concert like no other he had ever 
attended before. At this concert, J.P. won the "Why should Britney Spears date 
you contest" and Britney sang to J.P. on stage at the Bi-Lo center in 
Greenville. If that isn't enough, J.P. also has the ability to call in his 
secret weapon, nuclear missile strike.

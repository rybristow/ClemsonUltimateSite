<font face="Arial Bold" size=16 color=White> Ben Slade </font> <br>
<font face="'Browallia New'" size="4" color="white" a> Our Fearless leader. Ben Slade began playing frisbee in 2003 when he was a freshman
at Covenant College. THe winter league there in Chattanooga is really where Ben sank his teeth into the sport and got hooked. With a track,
Cross country, basketball triple threat background, Ben had the perfect background to play ultimate. Ben has tried to add a new throw to his
arsenal every year. This year, he is adding the thumber. Last year, he mastered the scoober and now uses it frequently. Ben uses the scoober
almost destructively against opposing defenses and especially against shorter players. Something strangely coincidental is that Ben's first
frisbee tournament was Joint Summit back in 2004. He came with a young, new Covenant team and left with an 0-7 record. However, as time 
tells, he stayed with the sport. Clemson is lucky he did. As the oldest brother in a family with seven sons, Ben says "I have six younger
brothers that all play ultimate. All of them will be better than me someday." They are going to have a tough time.

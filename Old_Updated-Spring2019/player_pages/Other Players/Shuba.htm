<font face="'Browallia New'" size="4" color="white" > Shuba is a late comer to Clemson Ultimate. However, he has wasted little time in making a huge impact on the 
team. Zach has only actually been playing frisbee for a year and a half. He learned from his intramural frisbee teams, which happened to also be back to back champions.

"I have never broken a bone." Boom Roasted!

<font face="Arial Bold" size=16 color="White"> Michael Brophy </font> <br>
<font face="Browallia New" size="4" color="white" > It was a cold, Winter night. 1989 was a pretty unforgiving year to the U.S. Americans saw the deaths ofs ome
of their favortie stars die, such as Dan Broderick, Amanda Blake, and Jack Mahoney die. 1989 was also a historical turning point for the wave of revolutions that swept 
the Eastern Bloc, starting in Poland that heralded the death of the Soviet Union and beginning of the post-Cold War era of United STates dominance
in world affairs. But before any of this could happen, Michael Richard Franklin Cornelius Brophy was born, April 23rd, 1989. I know what you're thinking. "Isn't that
the same day Kareem Abdul-Jabbar had his retirement ceremony in LA?" Yes, yes it is. Anywho, as  Brophy was growing up, he got skinny, and super runny, so he ran. Michael 
ran track and cross country in high school. He began playing frisbee pick-up when he was a freshman in high school. When he arrived at Clemson four years ago, he 
joined the cycling club. If you are from Clemson/ have been around, you may have seen him out on the roads in one of those sweet, skin tight outfits the cyclists wear.
Something interesting about brohpy is that he does yoga. Brophy is also the team doctor since he knows his ANATOMY! Seriously, he is super helpful for those injured.
Brophy plays frisbee because it is a fun, fast-paced sport. Brophy's favorite frisbee memory is his first hammer for a score in Fall League. When asked if there is anything else he 
can think of, he replies "nope."

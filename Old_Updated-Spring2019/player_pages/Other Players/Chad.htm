<font face="Arial Bold" size=16 color=White> Chad Bennett </font> <br>
<font face="'Browallia New'" size="4" color="white" a> Chad R. Bennett has been playing ultimate since he came to Clemson University as a 
very athletic baseball player. He began playing intramural frisbee and decided, "this is pretty sweet,"(direct quotation). Chad learned a lot
from an older friend who goes by Gavin Richards. As a kid, Chad played everything. He played baseball, played swimming, played D, and 
his number one rule for younger players, "PLAY FRIGGIN' D!!" His favorite throw is an inverted backhand to Tyler in the cup. Now whether
Chad is in the cup or whether Tyler is, I'm not sure. Something relatively interesting about Chad in his own words
is "I am half black, half asian, but for some reason, God dipped me in the white sauce before he finished me." Chad is looking forward to having
a strong Senior campaign and has high expectations after not being able to come out much in the Fall. Where has he been? 
Studying to become real smart.

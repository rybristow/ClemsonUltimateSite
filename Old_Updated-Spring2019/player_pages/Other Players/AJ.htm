<font face="Arial Bold" size=16 color=White> AJ "Mr. Huckstable" Holloway</font> <br>
<font face="'Browallia New'" size="4" color="white" > AJ is 6'0, 170 lbs of determination, and he's a senior! AJ is what I like to call a late bloomer when
it comes to frisbee. He just began playing his sophomore year when he took a pair of ultimate frisbee classes under the guidance of Ben Slade. AJ had the
perfect sports background for frisbee in high school as he was a wide receiver for his high school football team, and also played on the basketball team
and ran track. A lethal combination to say the least. AJ's favorite throw used to be the dump, in all situations. However, last year AJ had a revelation. 
Ben Slade isn't the only person who can throw bombs on the team. I can too. So, AJ became, the huckstable. And the team's never been the same since.
Last year at Terminus, one team saw the bite of AJ's sweet bombs, as he threw a backhand for an embarrassing score. That other team has never been the same since.
He is ready to pull it out at any part of the game to defeat the opponent. When asked of an important thing to know about AJ before you meet him
he commented "My DNA leads people to believe I'm half black, half white. But my talent leads me to belive I'm half man, half amazing." AJ's 
quick motto is, work hard, play <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsO6ZnUZI0g"><span class="link"> HARDER</span></a>.

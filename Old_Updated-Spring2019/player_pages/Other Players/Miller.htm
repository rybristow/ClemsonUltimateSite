<font face="Arial Bold" size=16 color=White> Miller Yoho </font> <br>
<font face="'Browallia New'" size="4" color="white" > Miller began playing frisbee as a young tike in youth group. He had the pleasure of being bigger than others and hence began
the physical nature of his play. Miller's favorite throw is whatever keeps Viper from yelling at him. As Miller has grown
into a more complete ultimate player, his new favorite throw is bombs. Forehand bombs specifically. Miller played baseball in high school
which doesn't really go along with ultimate. However, he was very sassy most of the time while playing, which goes along
perfectly with ultimate, jk. He has been playing for nine years, but more importantly played with Furman during his undergraduate years in
college which are now no more. Miller likes to add that despite all that time, he is still mediocre. Miller mainly plays frisbee for the ladies.
 Important and exciting things to know about Miller are that his shoulders are double jointed and he can eat
six saltines in under a minute with no water. Miller likes to add "Viper is actually my friend." Boom Ross. Boom.Also, Miller is an old man 
nowadays and still works harder than you, sometimes... When asked what is something he wants all his competitors to 
know before they play him, he simply replied "My hips don't lie."</font>

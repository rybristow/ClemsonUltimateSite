<font face="Arial Bold" size=16 color="White"> Will "Flash" "Commisioner" "Troy" Gordon </font> <br>
<font face="Browallia New" size="4" color="white" > Will Gordan is quite a character. He has a lot of personality. And this personality shines the most, in van rides. 
His sports background includes Russell Westbrook dunking on his laptop and a picture of an owl on his phone so not so much.  But what he lacks in sports background he makes up for
in passtime where he likes to be creative, creatively though.  If he could be anyone for a day it would be Niles Brinton no shock there.  When asked for a quote he wouldnt stop talking
about the morning show he hosts with Nick "WILL AND NICK IN THE MORNING!".  Still don't know what that means.  Will is a one man wolf pack, unless he is around Nick then they are a two
man wolf pack, unless around James then they split up and run so as to not ruin the two man wolfpack.  When asked his favorite nickname he stated "Commisioner Gordon was cool but Will
really seems to be sticking".  Ladies and Gents Will Gordon.

<font face="Arial Bold" size=16 color=White> Christian "Gun" Gaeta </font> <br>
<font face="'Browallia New'" size="4" color="white" a>Christian is well, fast. Real fast. He makes fast guys look, not so fast. At his
heart, however, Christian is a surfer. He has surfed his entire life and his home is on the Isle of Palms, just a few blocks from the Atlantic 
Ocean. When it comes to frisbee though, he is , well, fast. As a kid, he dominated the tee-ball diamond. In high school, Christian also did very well in track, hes so modest he
would never tell you but he is the AA State Champ in the 800m. Along with that, he has also spent several summers playing in the Charleston
summer league. Most of all, however, Christian dedicates his current game to his older brother, Justin. An awesomely interesting fact
about Christian is that he is sponsered by Charleston Water Sports for surfing. In short, Christian is 6'0, sorta, or should I say,
shorta, Roman Catholic, and colorblind. He has lived his entire life right down the street from the ocean and played the flute in middle 
school. When asked for a quote he said "I blessed the rains down in Africa".  Well put Gaeta well put.

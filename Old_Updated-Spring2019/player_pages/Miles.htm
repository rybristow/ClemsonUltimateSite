<p >
<font face="Arial Bold" size=16 color="White"> Miles "Big Nuts" McDonald </font> <br>
<font face="Browallia New" size="4" color="white" > The Chattanooga boy who is downright nasty to defenses when handling, Miles McDonald has been playing
frisbee since there was frisbee. However, he began playing organised ultimate frisbee six years ago at his local, Mcallie, high school. His team was actually quite good
and they went to high school easterns, Padeia Cup, and even Terminus. Miles was even the captain of the team his Junior and Senior Years of high school.
Miles' favorite throw is his "slap yo mutha nasty" low release flick and his "cherry on top" high release flick. When Miles gets older,
he plans on proudly being a ninth generation Tennessee farm owner. Miles is form Chattanooga, TN. When he dies, he wants to handle on a never-ending zone point
for the rest of eternity. In a final word from Miles, "They call me Big Nuts."

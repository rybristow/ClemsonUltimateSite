<font face="Arial Bold" size=16 color="White"> James "The Freshman Sensation" Cox </font> <br>
<font face="Browallia New" size="4" color="white" > James Cox was born August 9, 1990 into a family, recently, of five. James had early exposure to frisbee
in life where he actually learned to throw a backhand with a purple, dog-chewed, frisbee. James' next big moment in life, of course, was he learned to walk. 
He is an eagle scout and in BSA Troop 235 James first learned to play ultimate frisbee. At Camp Old Indian in the Summers, James would spend all of his free time 
down in the meadow playing frisbee and dirtying his class A uniform simultaneously. His first sky was on a first year scout, when he was a fifth year scout. James
still considered it a huge accomplishment. James claims "The kid was big for his age, kinda." Living in Clemson, James also began playing Tuesday and Thursday pick-up 
on Bowman during the Summers. The Summer before James' Senior year of high school, he met a tall, gangly lefty named Ben Slade. Admittedly, James did not really know
what to make of this fellow. However, he must have done something right because Ben invited James to come out and play Fall League with the Clemson club ultimate team.
The rest is history. Anywho, James' favorite throw is his low release around backhand. His favorite frisbee memory is winning ACC's at Tally Classic and holding
one of his BF's Kyle Corley in his arms afterwards. James is actually writing this, his own player bio, at 5:33 AM after a night of not sleeping. James would like to mention,
he loves his family, waking up early, the outdoors, and music, and he Doesn't care who knows!

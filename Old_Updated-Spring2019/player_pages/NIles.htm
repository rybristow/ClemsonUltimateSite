<font face="Arial Bold" size=16 color="White"> Niles Brinton </font> <br>
<font face="Browallia New" size="4" color="white" > Costa Rica is an interesting country. It is the "greenest" country in the world. In 2007,
the Costa Rican government announced that the country plans to be the first carbon neutral country by 2021. Niles studied abroad during the spring of his sophomore year.
Some of that time, he spent in Costa Rica, which makes sense because Niles is also an advocate for a "greener" Clemson, South Carolina, America, and eventually, World. 
However, when Niles is playing frisbee, which he has been doing for some time now, he usually throws a flick, or a backhand. Not many hammers, though. 
Niles has a sports background filled with running. Something nice to know is that he also just built a bike. That's pretty neat. Niles plays frisbee for the glory. 
Niles' favorite frisbee memory is waking up to find that Kenny had urinated on Gaeta at some point in the night. Niles Brinton.

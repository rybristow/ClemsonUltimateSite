A step forward in our quest to finally learn how to play ultimate, the one day Battle over Georgia tournament hosted by UGA, proved to very valuable.  Our rookies received a lot of valuable playing time and experience playing for our B-team.  (This was also the first tournament in clemson history that we have ever fielded a B-team).  Their 2-3 record,beating SPSU and UGA-B and loosing to Ga. Tech-A, UGA-A and Berry, was rather impressive for their first tourney.  The A-team won their pool (4-0) with a character building win against GSU, where, after being down 5-1, won 11-10.  Playing for the spot of first place, our team looked strong against UGA and even in 13-10 loss, the team is sensing to get some confidence in our playing.  The tournament proved for an overall cohesion to form within the team, perfect preparation for Mudbowl next weekend...

A break out tourney for many players, and a chance to establish ourselves as a strong team, Mudbowl proved to be another great building block for our season.  Going 5-2 on the weekend was good considering both of the loses were to eventual tournament winners, UGA.  The most exciting game of the tournament was Sunday's semi-final mtach up against "Jojah" with a crowd of 40+ spectators heckling and cheering.  The game was very intensively fought, with Clemson leading 10-8 at one point.  In the end, UGA pulled out the victory, but not with out a scare.  WE earned a some respect from fellow teams and are now looking forward to Terminus...

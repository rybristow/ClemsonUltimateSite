And we're off...An early start to this years ultimate season, the tournament proved to be both challenging and educational. Well hosted and well planned by the University of Florida, the tournament gave every team lots of playing time before heading into the rest of the season and sectionals.  We started the tournament 4-0 and ended up 4-3.  You can teach a lot at practice, but some stuff just needs to be learned on the field.  Adjustments and improvement were made, and with practice, we wont be making the same mistakes twice.  Overall a good start to the season, looking forward to what lies ahead...

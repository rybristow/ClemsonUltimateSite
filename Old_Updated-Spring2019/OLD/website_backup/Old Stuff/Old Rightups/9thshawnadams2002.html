Spirit of the Game
Ultimate Tournament!</A> 
</CENTER>
<BR>The 2002-2003 season looks promising for the newly revived Clemson Ultimate <B>Joint Chiefs of Waft.</B>  The season opened up with the 9th Annual Shawn Adams, which included great weather, great fields and great competition.  The Tourney was held in Chattanooga, TN at Camp Jordan Park.  Our pool consisted of Tanasi, Georgia Tech, Asheville Ultimate and Berry College.  We finished Saturday 2-2 losing to Tanasi & Asheville Ultimate.  We started off Sunday morning playing SRA Allstars, and in a tight game, won 13-11 advancing to the quarter finals to play Tanasi once again.  In a better game then the first day, we lost to Tanasi 13-7 and went home with a 3-3 record, but with a feeling of accomplishment.  Only 6 practices had been held since everyone returned from Summer break, and we grew a lot as a team through out the course of the tourney.

<BR>Memorable moments of the Tourney:
<BR>1-Beating Ga Tech for the first time in several years.  We have the chance to play Ga. Tech several times each year due to our proximity and have yet to play well against them.  
<BR>2-game 5 vs. SRA Allstars: This team was ranked ahead of us and we went out and executed our game plan and won.  We went up in the first half, and kept the lead, something that we were not prone to doing before.  The team started playing like a team, and we started to see some potential for the future.
<BR>3-losing to Tanasi again: although we lost, we played them much tighter than we had on saturday, evidence of growth of the team.  After the game, Tanasi told us that we were a different team then when we had played on saturday.
<BR>4-And last but not least!  THE RIDE HOME!  Fuddruckers, sorority girls from Auburn, and Trevor's Milkshakes (It's always a highlight of the tournament when Trevor shuts up. So we refuse to play tournaments without a near by McDonald's)

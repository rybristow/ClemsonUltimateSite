The Highlight so far of our 2002-2003 season is hands down this tourney.  We took 20 players, 8 returning from last year, 11 rookies, and 1 graduate student new to the team. Baldwin, being at the end of the fall, allowed us to try out everything we have been working on and position ourselves for the spring.   This semester (fall 2002) has been a rollercoaster of events and emotions that culminated at this tourney.   We finished the tourney ranked 3rd after entering the tournament in the 12-13th seed.  The conditions were intense, 37F and rainy. The fields were pretty much under water, and the grass turned into mud sometime after the third game.  All the same, we played, and we went 4-0 on saturday for the first time in 7 years.  Our pool consisted of GSU, Indiana, V. Tech and UT-B/Alumni.  Saturday was simply crazy.  The entire team, whether we were getting playing time or not, were completely behind the team.  Our side lines never sat down, despite the conditions, and were always on their feet cheering.  We invented sideline cheers (a Clemson first) and started new traditions. We finished the tourney 5-1, losing in the semi-finals to Notre Dame (8-11).  All and all a good weekend of ultimate to head into the spring with...

<BR><U>Memorable moments of the Tourney:</U>
<BR>1-Beating Indiana-This was one of the toughest games of the tourney, and we came out victorious. Last year we would have lost this game. It has been a Clemson Ultimate tradition in the past few years to lose the hard ones. Not this time! We endured and beat the one of the best teams at the tourney.  There was one point that lasted at least 10+ minutes, and in the end, after multiple turns by each team, we scored, taking the lead and momemtum.  Winning this game changed everyones mind set about the team and our future. 
<BR>2-Defense competition-A suprising layout D compition broke out in the final game sat. between Brando Tornado and Trevor, brando held the edge at half but could not over come trevors back to back layouts and lost 4-2 in the end. 
<BR>3-Tim & our 4-0 run on Saturday-Playing sparingly, Tiny still managed to outscore Tim until a despration pass found its way into the seniors hands to cap our 4-0 saturday. Despite the frostbite that ravaged our bodies, it still translated into an overall good feeling knowing that we had gone 4-0 for our first time.
<BR>4-Trevor's Milkshakes-Yes, Trevor did get his milkshake, and everyone was happy.
<BR>5-And last but not least! It was great to see the older guys showing good leadership and really forming a strong backbone for the team.

	In the fall of 2001, Clemson University established their first Women's Ultimate Frisbee team. Captains Lauren Bates and Stephanie Weeks led the team of 18 players. The Clemson Women's team chose the name C.R.U.S.H (Clemson Raw Ultimate Sexy Huckers). Although CRUSH has a few returning players this year, the team is primarily young with no seniors. However, we are strong, unified, and determined to be successful again this season. CRUSH always welcomes new players whether they are experienced or not. Their goal is to open the eyes of other women to this new, exciting, and fast growing sport. CRUSH hopes to spread the message that Ultimate Frisbee is not just for men and that there are many universities now carrying all women's teams. Ultimate is not only a good form of exercise, but a great learning experience as well. CRUSH encourages everyone to come out and give Ultimate Frisbee a try. CRUSH practices every Monday 5:30-7:30, Tuesday 6-8, and Thursday from 7-9 on the club sports fields. Check out www.upa.org for more information about Ultimate Frisbee and the official rules of the game.

Hosted by FSU, the tournament proved top be good training ground for our rookies.  3 of the 7 starters went along with a few other experienced players to help build depth in the team.  Over-all the rookies played really well, with many people stepping up.  The biggest thing i noticed was that most of them were making good decisions, regardless of what happened with that good decisions, the skills will soon follow.  The tournament was real relaxed due to complications with fields, etc.  Unfortunately, as a side effect, 4 of the 6 games we played were capped.  Games were supposed to be to 15, but few reached 11.  We had three universe points in the tourney out of 6 games, but could only win one of them, but thats the way things go, we will do better next time.
